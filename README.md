# Master the Coding Interview
This repo contains all the JS files I wrote studying for the technical interview. (Covering Data Structures and Algorithms)
The course I took was [Master the Interview by ZTM](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms).
This course has ...
- Demystified the technical interview process, providing clarity on what to expect and how to prepare effectively.
- Refined my understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms, giving me a strong base upon which to build practical application.
- Equipped me with a structured approach to problem-solving, showing me how to think critically when faced with challenging coding questions, which will be a useful skill as I move on to LeetCode.

## The topics covered in the course:
- Getting the Interview
- Big O Notation
- Data Structures
  - Arrays
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Linked Lists
  - Trees
  - Tries
  - Graphs
  - Hash Tables
- Algorithms
  - Sorting
  - Dynamic Programming
  - BFS + DFS (Searching)
  - Recursion
- Non Technical Interviews
- Offer + Negotiation
